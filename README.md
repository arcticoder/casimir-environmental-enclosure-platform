## Development Status, Scope, Validation & Limitations

- Scope: Prototype implementations, simulation studies, and digital-twin experiments. This repository documents model development and prototype demonstrations rather than validated production systems.
- Validation: Select validation artifacts and UQ summaries are referenced from `docs/`. Where specific claims are made, they are supported by simulation or prototype test artifacts — consult `docs/UQ-notes.md` and `docs/benchmarks.md` for provenance, scripts, and CI outputs when available.
- Limitations: Reported metrics are conditional on test fixtures, solver parameters, environmental control, and calibration. Claims about readiness, crewed operation, or production deployment require formal V&V, independent review, and certifications.

If you maintain or extend this repository, please add links to raw data, benchmark scripts, and UQ analysis used to support specific claims; include clear test conditions and provenance in `docs/`.

## Applications and Notes

This repository includes prototype methods and example experiments relevant to precision environmental control and digital-twin-enhanced research. Descriptions of potential applications and reported performance should be read in the context of validation artifacts and UQ documentation.

Reported percentage improvements and numerical 'enhancement' figures summarize results from controlled experiments or simulations; they are not general guarantees and should be accompanied by reproducibility materials when cited.

## Operational Integration & Safety Notes

Sections that describe crewed life-support integration or mission-readiness are illustrative and conceptual. They summarize research ideas or integration scenarios used in simulations; they do not indicate operational certification or deployment readiness.

Any claims about life-support readiness, crew capacity, mission duration, or safety certification must be substantiated through engineering development, independent testing, and regulatory approval before operational use.
_Illustrative example only — not a validated life-support specification. Treat parameters below as simulation placeholders requiring engineering V&V._
