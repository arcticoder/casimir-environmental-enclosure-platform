Short description:
Prototype research and simulation artifacts for environmental control systems used in precision experiments. Includes digital-twin models, control experiments, and UQ workflows. Not production-ready.

Long description:
This repository collects research-stage models, simulation studies, and prototype integrations focused on environmental control (vacuum systems, thermal management, vibration isolation) for precision measurement and digital-twin research. The materials include examples of model formulations, prototype control strategies, and uncertainty-quantification analyses intended for reproducibility and further research.

Please treat numerical summaries and reported performance as provisional results based on controlled experiments or simulations. For traceability, consult the `docs/` folder for raw data, benchmark scripts, and UQ notes. Maintain clear provenance for any claims and add test artifacts when extending the repository.
