Suggested GitHub About (hedged)

Short description (suggested):

"Research-stage repository exploring environmental control for precision experiments (vacuum, thermal, vibration isolation) and a digital-twin framework for reproducibility and UQ. Performance figures are preliminary and conditional on test configurations."

Scope, Validation & Limitations
- Scope: documents prototype implementations, simulation studies, and example integration scenarios. Not a production-ready environmental control system.
- Validation: validation artifacts, benchmark scripts, and UQ summaries (if present) should be linked from the About text (look for `docs/UQ-notes.md`, `docs/benchmarks.md`, or `docs/` folders).
- Limitations: reported metrics are dataset- and configuration-dependent; experimental reproducibility and full uncertainty quantification (UQ) are incomplete.

Suggested maintainer action:
- Replace the repository About/description with the hedged text above or a shortened hedged variant.
- Link to `docs/UQ-notes.md` and `docs/benchmarks.md` (or CI results) in the About/README for transparency.

Pointers for UQ / Reproducibility (if present in repo):
- Link to notebooks or directories named `notebooks`, `uq`, `analysis`, `examples`, or `repro`.
- If CI badges are available, link to the specific job or commit that demonstrates passing tests and the UQ artifacts used to produce the claims.

Contact:
- Open an issue tagging @maintainers with a link to this file for help drafting a condensed About message.
